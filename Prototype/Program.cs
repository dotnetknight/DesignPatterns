    //Prototype Design Pattern specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
    //To simplify the above definition, we can say that, the Prototype Design Pattern gives us a way to create new objects from the existing instance of the object. That means it clone the existing object with its data into a new object. If we do any changes to the cloned object (i.e. new object) then it does not affect the original object.

    //Points to Remember:
    // The MemberwiseClone method is part of the System.Object class and it creates a shallow copy of the given object. 
    //MemberwiseClone Method only copies the non-static fields of the object to the new object
    //In the process of copying, if a field is a value type, a bit by bit copy of the field is performed.If a field is a reference type, the reference is copied but the referenced object is not.
